# Hi, I'm Sysia 👋

I'm building zero-entropy architectures for next-generation AI systems.  
Author of **ANCHORFIELD**, **AI-B-C8**, **TFC-3**, and the **ZEDPAI Ω9** theoretical framework.

I work at the intersection of:
- synchronised artificial intelligence  
- neural data integrity  
- trit-based quantisation (AKOrN)  
- compression protocols (TRIT5_PACK)  
- frame pipelines (TFC-3)  
- SHA-256 + Merkle verification  
- consciousness-linked system design  

I’m also the founder of **StrefaDK** — an educational & analytical hub for players, focusing on awareness, system transparency and zero-entropy thinking.
